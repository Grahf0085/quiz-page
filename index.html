            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Arch Linux is a Linux distribution for computers with x86-64 processors. Arch Linux adheres to the KISS principle ("Keep It Simple, 
                Stupid") and is focused on simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user centrality, and versatility. In practice, this means the project 
                attempts to have minimal distribution-specific changes, and therefore minimal breakage with updates, and be pragmatic over ideological 
                design choices and focus on customizability rather than user-friendliness. A package manager written specifically for Arch Linux, Pacman,
                is used to install, remove and update software packages. Arch Linux uses a rolling release model, meaning there are no "major releases" of 
                completely new versions of the system; a regular system update is all that is needed to obtain the latest Arch software; the installation 
                images released every month by the Arch team are simply up-to-date snapshots of the main system components. Arch Linux has comprehensive 
                documentation, which consists of a community wiki known as the ArchWiki.</p>

            <h2>Quote</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>"Relying on complex tools to manage and build your system is going to hurt the end-users. [...] "If you try to hide the complexity of the system, you'll end up with a more complex system". Layers of abstraction that serve to hide internals are never a good thing. Instead, the internals should be designed in a way such that they NEED no hiding.""
